                            <p>
                                Programming languages, JavaScript inclusive, do not execute comments. The purpose of comments are to help the programmer remember the funtion or purpose for the lines of code; it also makes the program easy to read and understand. Data types, <em>string, numbers, symbols, booleans, numbers, null, undefined, and object,</em> are the foundation upon which JavaScript is built. The first six are primitive data types and the last is non-primitive.<br><br>The ES6 version of JavaScript recommends that <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> keywords should be used to declare variables. Variables that cannot be changed should be declared as const, whereas those that can change should be declared as let.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A few new ordered lists were introduced in ES6 to compliment Arrays. They include Sets and Maps. Arrays can be single or multidimensional. The key difference between an array, a set and a map is that set contains unique values, an array contains duplicate values, and a map uses the key-pair technique.<br><br>The flow of statements is controlled using the <em>if</em> and <em>else</em> statement. An <em>if statement</em> can be nested. However, <strong>switch</strong> statement is recommended in place of long if/else statements.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In addition to reducing the number of lines a programmer will write, a function makes it easier to reuse code, stop and start the execution of a program, provide an input value for other functions. Every function returns a value whether explicitly stated or not. When variables are placed in the parenthesis of a function during its declaration, those variables are referred to as <em>parameters,</em> but when they are provinded during a function call, they are known as arguments.
